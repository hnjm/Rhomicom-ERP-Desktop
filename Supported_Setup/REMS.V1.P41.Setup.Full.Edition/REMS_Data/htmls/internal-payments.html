<p>10.	<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">INTERNAL PAYMENTS MODULE</span></span></p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">A.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">INTRODUCTION: - </span>This module as the name implies handles all payments to persons defined as part of the Organisation irrespective of their person type. Once the person has the pay item actively assigned to him/her then payment can be made to/by that person. Before this module can be used, Pay Items, Pay Item Sets, Person Sets must be defined.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">B.<span style="font-weight:bold;">	DEFINE PAY ITEMS</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">i.	These are the Items we use to pay people internally. E.g. there can be welfare contributions payment item, annual leave days’ payment item, annual leave days’ withdrawal item, etc. Each pay item can then feed into a Balance Item either cumulatively or non-cumulatively.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ii.	To create pay items click on Pay Items on the Left Main Menu.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	Click on ADD</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	Provide the Item Code/Name and Description</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Local Classification: -</span> Based on how the Organisation intends to classify its Pay Items one of the Classifications defined in the attached LOV can be selected for reporting purposes.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vi.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Item Major Type: -</span> either Balance Item or Pay Value Item can be selected. If balance item is selected it means this item cannot be used to pay anybody directly but will just store the net balance of payments made with other pay value items that feed into it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Item Minor Type: - </span>The options here are Bills/Charges, Deductions, Earnings, Employer Charges and purely informational. Bills/Charges and Deductions are items persons pay to the Organisation. Earnings are items the Organisation Pays to or on behalf of persons in the Organisation. Purely Informational Items usually have no accounting implication and can either be paid by the person or the organisation.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">viii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Item UOM: -</span> Possible Values are money or Number. For non-currency based items like leave days, loan repayment periods/months always use number.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ix.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Pay Frequency: - </span>As the name implies determines how often this payment can or must be allowed to be made.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">x.<span style="font-weight:bold;">	Pay Run Priority: -</span> determines which pay item should be run first during mass pay runs. Lower Numbers are always run first.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xi.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Balance Type: - </span>Cumulative Balances always keep building up and they store balances since the day of assignment to the person involved to date. Non-cumulative balance items only get balances during a mass pay run and their balances start from zero again in the next pay run.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Costing Account: - </span>For Earnings/Employer Charges you can Increase an Expense Account, Decrease a Liability or Increase a Receivable Account. For Deductions/Bills/Charges one can Increase a Revenue Account or Decrease a Receivable Account</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xiii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Balancing Account: - </span>For Earnings/Employer Charges one can Decrease a Cash Account or Increase a Liability Account whereas For Deductions/Bills/Charges one can Increase a Cash Account or Decrease a Liability Account</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xiv.	If this pay item will use SQL formulas to compute its payment amounts then check the Uses SQL Formula to get Item Values Check Box.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xv.	Also check the Is Enabled Check Box to enable this pay Item</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xvi.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">BALANCE ITEM FEEDS: - </span>If this Item is a balance Item then one can add all the already defined Pay Items one will want to be contributing to the balance store on this Item. Otherwise if it is a Pay Value Item the same section can be used to add all the Balance Items whose balances this Pay Item will be contributing to. To add just click on the ADD button in that section. Select the Item Name. Indicate the Action i.e. whether the selected item adds to the Balance or subtracts from the Balance. If it is not the whole pay value one wants to add or subtract from the balance then indicate the scale factor or fractional multiplier.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xvii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">PAY ITEM POSSIBLE VALUES: -</span> This section at the extreme right is where all the possible pay values for the currently selected item are defined. If the Item uses SQL formula, that formula is also specified here.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">C.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINE DEFAULT ITEM SETS</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">i.	Pay Item Sets are just a way of organizing the defined Pay Items/Elements into Groups so that during payment one sees only the set of pay items to be worked on at the time and not just every other pay item. It makes payments easier rather than the alternative of showing every pay item for the person and having to search for a particular item before paying.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ii.	To get here click on Pay Item Sets on the Left Main Menu</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	Click on ADD</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	Provide the Item Set Name and Description</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	Check the Is Enabled Check Box to enable this Item Set.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vi.	If one wants this item set to be displayed by default when the main payment form is opened then check the Is Default Pay Item Set Check Box</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vii.	If one wants to use SQL Statement to decide what items should be part of this set instead of having to add them one by one then this check box must also be checked.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">viii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Pay Item Set SQL Query: -</span> This is the place for typing and testing the query behind this Item Set if the Use SQL Check box was checked.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ix.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Item Set Details Section: -</span> This section at the extreme right shows a list of the Pay Items that make up this set. If this set uses SQL then the system runs the SQL and shows you the Pay Items that met the selection criteria of the SQL statement otherwise this is the list of Pay Items one added manually. To add more items just click on the ADD button in that section</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">D.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINE DEFAULT PERSON SETS</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">i.	Person Sets are just a way of organizing the Persons in the Organisation into Groups so that during payment one sees only the set of persons to be worked on at the time and not just every other person. It makes payments easier rather than the alternative of showing every person and having to search for a particular person before paying.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ii.	To get here click on Person Sets on the Left Main Menu</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	Click on ADD</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	Provide the Person Set Name and Description</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	Check the Is Enabled Check Box to enable this Person Set.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vi.	If one wants this person set to be displayed by default when the main payment form is opened then check the Is Default Person Set Check Box</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vii.	If one wants to use SQL Statement to decide which persons should be part of this set instead of having to add them one by one then this check box must also be checked.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">viii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Person Set SQL Query: -</span> This is the place for typing and testing the query behind this Person Set if the Use SQL Check box was checked.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ix.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Person Set Details Section: -</span> This section at the extreme right shows a list of the Persons that make up this set. If this set uses SQL then the system runs the SQL and shows you the Persons that met the selection criteria of the SQL statement otherwise this is the list of Persons one added manually. To add more persons just click on the ADD button in that section</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">E.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">ASSIGN PAY ITEMS TO PERSONS</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">i.	This form is for deciding what items can be paid to a person or what items a person can pay in the organisation.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ii.	Payments to or by the person with regards to a particular pay item can only go through successfully if the Item is actively assigned to the person.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	To get to this interface click on Manual Payments on the Left Main Menu.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	Go to the top right section and Click on the Tab Header Labeled PERSON’S ASSIGNED PAY ITEMS</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	On display will be all the Pay Items currently assigned to the currently selected/highlighted person on the left side.</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px;">vii.	On the other hand if one wants to assign an item to more than one person then click on the GROUP ASSIGNMENTS button. Here too the Item Name and Value Name are specified. The type of Group is indicated and the specific name of the group selected from the attached LOV button. Validity period is also specified. Click on APPLY ITEM TO ALL GROUP MEMBERS button when done.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">viii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Show Balance Amounts: - </span>Besides the GROUP ASSIGNMENTS button is a check box labelled Show Balance Amounts. Check this and click on refresh if one wants to see the latest balances on all the balance items assigned to this person.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">F.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">ENTER PERSON’S BANK ACCOUNTS IF APPLICABLE</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">i.	Where the organisation intends to send payments to persons to their respective bank accounts whenever payment is run then the bank accounts of the persons involved must be captured on this form.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ii.	To get to this interface click on Manual Payments on the Left Main Menu.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	Go to the top right section and Click on the Tab Header Labeled PERSON’S BANKS</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	On display will be all the Bank Accounts currently defined for the currently selected/highlighted person on the left side.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	To define a new bank account for this person click on the button with the green plus icon. Specify the bank details and the percentage of the net pay amount or the exact amount that is to be sent to this account. NB: at the Portions Unit of Measure side one only changes to percent to money if the figure provide is supposed to be the actual money amount and not a percentage figure.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">G.<span style="font-weight:bold;">	MANUAL PAYMENTS</span></p>

<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	Go to the top right section and Click on the Tab Header Labelled PAYMENT</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	On display will be 3 MAIN SECTIONS. The Persons to be paid on the LEFT, The Items to be paid in the Middle and the Payment form itself on the right with historical payments for the currently selected/highlighted person and item right beneath it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	Before one makes any payment one must make sure the person set selected under persons is the set of people to be paid or from whom payments are to be received.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vi.	Also make sure the Item set selected is the set of items one wants to pay or receive payments for</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">vii.	Once all of this is done just select or highlight the specific person and the specific item to be used in recording the payment. Go to the far right under NEW PAYMENT section and provide the payment date, and amount. The default description can be modified if desired. If one wants the accounting transactions to impact a different date other than the one specified then the GL date can be changed. There is a Default Amount displayed at the Top Right Corner and it contains the pre-defined amount on the person’s item value name or the results of computing the SQL formula behind his/her item value name. This is just displayed as a guide in determining the actual payment amount. Click on PROCESS PAYMENT button to complete the Payment.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">viii.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">QUICK PAYMENTS: -</span> If for the currently selected person one wants to quickly record payments against all the pay items in the item set then click on the RUN QUICK PAY button instead. Provide the Payment Date on the Dialog Box that shows up. Once the date is populated the system uses the other parameters that were defaulted to generate all the possible items that payments can be recorded against for the selected person. One can copy all the expected amounts or manually type in the amount against every pay item. Click on PROCESS PAYMENTS button on that form when done.

NB: In quick payments SQL formulas are not calculated, all figures/amounts must be provided manually. Where one wants a similar feature like Quick Pay Runs but wants SQL formulas to be computed then one must do a MASS PAY RUN.</p>
<p style="padding-left:40px;">H.	<span style="font-weight:bold;">MASS PAY RUNS</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">i.	There are times one wants to record payments for several people against several items whose values have been pre-determined either by an SQL formula or manually defined somewhere. For such situations mass pay run is the best.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ii.	To get to this interface click on Mass Pay Runs on the Left Main Menu.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iii.	On display will be 2 MAIN SECTIONS. The Left side shows all previously created mass pays and the right side shows the details of the currently selected mass pay run.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">iv.	To create a new Mass Pay click on ADD.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">v.	System Generates a Mass Pay Name which can be modified. Provide a description for the mass pay. Indicate the Payment Date and overwrite the GL date where necessary. The GL date is the date used for all accounting transactions behind this pay run.</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px;">vii.	Click on SAVE when done.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">viii.	Once saved make sure that mass pay run is the one selected/highlighted on the left list of pay runs. If one has to see and/or modify (in which case click on the EDIT button besides the ADD button first) the pre-defined values that are going to be used in the payments then click on the ATTACHED VALUES button. In the dialog box that pops up click on LOAD EDITABLE VALUES button to populate the mass pay persons and their item values which can be overwritten if desired. The values/amounts are saved automatically as one types. One can also load the values via Microsoft Excel Interface. Close the Dialog box when done.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">ix.	To start running the Mass Pay click on RUN MASS PAY button and monitor progress.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">x.	To roll back an already run mass pay click on ROLLBACK MASS PAY RUN when that mass pay run is the selected/highlighted one.</p>
<p style="padding-left:80px;">xi.	To transfer all the generated accounting transactions behind this mass pay to the accounting module then click on SEND MASS PAY RUN TO GL button.</p>
